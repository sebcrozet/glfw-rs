//! This example shows how shared objects can be accessed from callbacks
//!
//! This example should be seen as two different projects:
//!     * `middleware.rs` is written as if we are a middleware library writer.  Typically, such
//!     middleware library can be a graphics engine.
//!     * `main.rs` (this file) is written as if we are the user of the middleware library.
//!
//! The goal is to show how the middleware library writer can write its event handling in a
//! flexible way for the user. That is, he must both use glfw callbacks to update the scene (here
//! the `State` object), and to call some custom event handling provided by the user.
//!
//! The user will try to do a single, simple thing:Â count the total number of cursor and mouse
//! events and display it on its main loop.
